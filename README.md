FusioBERT: A BERT-based Model with Relative Position Bias for Antimicrobial Peptide Identification
This repository contains the official code and supplementary materials for the FusioBERT model, designed for antimicrobial peptide (AMP) identification and related downstream tasks. The model incorporates Relative Position Bias (RPB) to better capture short-range periodic patterns (i±3/i±4) critical for α-helical antimicrobial peptides.

🔍 Model Overview
FusioBERT is a transformer-based model optimized for short peptide sequence modeling, with the following key configurations:
- Backbone: BERT-like encoder (6 layers, 8 attention heads, d_model=320)
- Position Encoding: Sinusoidal Positional Encoding + Relative Position Bias (RPB)
- Normalization: RMSNorm (native PyTorch 2.4+)
- Feed-Forward Network: SwiGLU
- Pooling: Mean Pooling
Compared to models using Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE, e.g., ESM2), FusioBERT is more suitable for short peptide sequences (≤50 amino acids) and better captures the α-helical periodic patterns critical for AMP identification.
📊 Pre-training Data
The pre-training dataset was constructed from the UniProt Archive (UniParc) database, containing 19.18 million non-redundant peptide sequences (≤50 amino acids).
Raw data is publicly available at: https://www.uniprot.org/uniparc
Note: We do not upload the full pre-training data to GitHub due to size limitations. Users can download the raw data from the official UniParc link and preprocess it using the provided encoding function.

🏋️ Model Training
1. Pre-training (RPB Model)
Run the pre-training script for FusioBERT:
cd FusioBERT
nohup python -u train/train_bioamp_rpb.py > logs_bioamp_rpb.log 2>&1 
Key pre-training details:
- Pre-training data: Local parquet file (processed from UniParc)
- Sampling: 19.18 million sequences per epoch (aligned with PepBERT-large)
- Learning rate scheduling: SGDR + Warmup
- Checkpoints: Saved to checkpoints_bioamp_rpb/
- Logs: Saved to logs_bioamp_rpb.log
2. Fine-tuning (Classification Head)
Fine-tune the pre-trained model with a classification head for AMP identification (script not included here; use the classification head defined in inference/inference_rpb_classifier.py).
🔮 Inference for Candidate Peptides
Use the pre-trained FusioBERT model to predict AMP labels for candidate peptides (e.g., candidates_physicochem_filtered.csv).
Step 1: Prepare Input Data
Prepare candidate peptides in CSV format (example: data/example_candidates.csv):
sequence
FRWFFRSRQRRV
KYKRWRWYWNYQRR
RRGFIFRKRDKF
GSWRWWWWRLRRR
ILSFFRRRKWWRP
Step 2: Run Inference
python inference/inference_rpb_classifier.py
Step 3: View Results
Prediction results are saved to data/RPB_AMP_prediction.csv, including:
- sequence: Candidate peptide sequence
- predicted_label: 1 (AMP) / 0 (non-AMP)
- amp_probability: Probability of being an AMP (0-1)
